# MNIST-pytorch

Train various models on MNIST and other datasets! „ÄÅ
We will select models and datasets as small as possible so that these models can be easily trained on a laptop's GPU.

## Commands

Usage:

```sh
python main.py <command> -m <model-type> -d <dataset-name> -n <model-name>
```

A command could be: train, test, summary, show
A dataset_name could be: mnist, cifar-10
A model_type could be: lenet, mlp1, mlp2, mlp3

Example:

```sh
python main.py train -d cifar-10 -m lenet
```
